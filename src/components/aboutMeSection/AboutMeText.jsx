      <p>
      Iâ€™m Faical, a maintenance team leader and industrial engineering student with a passion for 
      maintenance and continuous improvement. I specialize in maintenance management, industrial 
      performance, and project management, aiming to deliver efficient and sustainable solutions. 
      I am also working towards becoming a technical trainer to share my knowledge and experience 
      with future engineers and professionals. Outside of work, I enjoy learning new methodologies 
      and tools to enhance industrial performance and inspire others in their professional journey.
